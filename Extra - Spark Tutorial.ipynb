    "# Spark Tutorial: Learning Apache Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will teach you how to use [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), a framework for large-scale data processing, within a notebook. Many traditional frameworks were designed to be run on a single computer.  However, many datasets today are too large to be stored on a single computer, and even when a dataset can be stored on one computer (such as the datasets in this tutorial), the dataset can often be processed much more quickly using multiple computers.  Spark has efficient implementations of a number of transformations and actions that can be composed together to perform data processing and analysis.  Spark excels at distributing these operations across a cluster while abstracting away many of the underlying implementation details.  Spark has been designed with a focus on scalability and efficiency.  With Spark you can begin developing your solution on your laptop, using a small dataset, and then use that same code to process terabytes or even petabytes across a distributed cluster.\n",

    "In Spark, communication occurs between a driver and executors.  The driver has Spark jobs that it needs to run and these jobs are split into tasks that are submitted to the executors for completion.  The results from these tasks are delivered back to the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Spark and its API we will need to use a `SparkContext`.  When running Spark, you start a new Spark application by creating a [SparkContext](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext).  When the `SparkContext` is created, it asks the master for some cores to use to do work.  The master sets these cores aside just for you; they won't be used for other applications. We have created the `SparkContext` automatically for you as `sc`."

    "In Spark, datasets are represented as a list of entries, where the list is broken up into many different partitions that are each stored on a different machine.  Each partition holds a unique subset of the entries in the list.  Spark calls datasets that it stores \"Resilient Distributed Datasets\" (RDDs).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the defining features of Spark, compared to other data analytics frameworks (e.g., Hadoop), is that it stores data in memory rather than on disk.  This allows Spark applications to run much more quickly, because they are not slowed down by needing to read data from disk.\n",

The second argument to the [sc.parallelize()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext.parallelize) method tells Spark how many partitions to break the data into when it stores the data in memory (we'll talk more about this later in this tutorial). Note that for better performance when using `parallelize`, `xrange()` is recommended if the input represents a range. This is the reason why we used `xrange()` in 2a.\n",

    "There are many different types of RDDs.  The base class for RDDs is [pyspark.RDD](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD) and other RDDs subclass `pyspark.RDD`.  Since the other RDD types inherit from `pyspark.RDD` they have the same APIs and are functionally identical.  We'll see that `sc.parallelize()` generates a `pyspark.rdd.PipelinedRDD` when its input is an `xrange`, and a `pyspark.RDD` when its input is a `range`."

    "So far, we've created a distributed dataset that is split into many partitions, where each partition is stored on a single machine in our cluster.  Let's look at what happens when we do a basic operation on the dataset.  Many useful data analysis operations can be specified as \"do something to each item in the dataset\".  These data-parallel operations are convenient because each item in the dataset can be processed individually: the operation on one entry doesn't effect the operations on any of the other entries.  Therefore, Spark can parallelize the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`map(f)`, the most common Spark transformation, is one such example: it applies a function `f` to each item in the dataset, and outputs the resulting dataset.  When you run `map()` on a dataset, a single *stage* of tasks is launched.  A *stage* is a group of tasks that all perform the same computation, but on different input data.  One task is launched for each partitition, as shown in the example below.  A task is a unit of execution that runs on a single machine. When we run `map(f)` within a partition, a new *task* applies `f` to all of the entries in a particular partition, and outputs a new partition. In this example figure, the dataset is broken into four partitions, so four `map()` tasks are launched.\n",

    "While both the `groupByKey()` and `reduceByKey()` transformations can often be used to solve the same problem and will produce the same answer, the `reduceByKey()` transformation works much better for large distributed datasets. This is because Spark knows it can combine output with a common key on each partition *before* shuffling (redistributing) the data across nodes.  Only use `groupByKey()` if the operation would not benefit from reducing the data before the shuffle occurs.\n",

Spark spills data to disk when there is more data shuffled onto a single executor machine than can fit in memory. However, it flushes out the data to disk one key at a time, so if a single key has more key-value pairs than can fit in memory an out of memory exception occurs. This will be more gracefully handled in a later release of Spark so that the job can still proceed, but should still be avoided.  When Spark needs to spill to disk, performance is severely impacted.\n",
